OOP - object oriented programing
class Bottle:
{'material': 'metal', 'usage' :'store liquids', 'color': white}


Classes: blueprint of objects 
Attributes: characteristic of the object 
Methods: functions related to a certain class - they denote the "behavior" of the object 
Object/Instance: is an example/one instance of the class, structured as a dictionary

4 pillars of OOP
-Inheritance
-Polymorphism
-Encapsulation
-Abstraction (not during this course)
